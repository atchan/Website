                Music has been in my life ever since I can remember. My mom loved to sing and listen to her oldies CDs, and my dad basked over Classical music and its relaxing melodies. I have been playing the piano since age 6, the trumpet since age 9, and I picked up the guitar when I was 13. Thanks to my parents, I have had the opportunity to learn all these instruments, and enjoy everything about them. Music allows me to praise the God I love, and it has taught me discipline, and given me an outlet for expression and creativity. My goal: to be a one man band.

                I grew up with a mom who brought me to church every Sunday, and I could not be more thankful for it. My faith is the reason I am still alive today, and it has given me everything, including the purpose to continue living life every single day. Christianity has taught me many things about myself, and the God I believe in, and it is a never-ending journey. It has taught me about love, forgiveness, compassion, family, friendship, and thanksgiving. There is hope and a bright future ahead. I believe in a message about love, and I believe that every person is in need of some.

                I have been dancing since I was 3-4 years old, and it has become a part of my life that I would not be able to live without. I am first and foremost, a ballerina, but coming into college I have also become someone capable of contemporary dance and urban hip hop. Dance has given me the most in being able to communicate when I have no words to say. It has taught me how to work hard for what I want, and it has given me a love for an art that has withstood the test of time. Dance allows me to be whoever I choose to be, and at the same time allows me to be completely myself.
